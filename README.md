While I was looking for a job, I applied many jobs and got rejection and positive response to move forward with job applications. I am going to try to build a model where I can define this email is rejection or next step. For that Deep Learning - NLP is going to be used. The data is taken from my personal emails. All sensittive information like email, names and phone numbers were excluded from the data.
